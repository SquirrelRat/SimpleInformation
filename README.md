* **Key Statistics at a Glance:** Tracks and displays:
    * Player Level
    * Current Area Name (including Map Tier)
    * Time Spent in Current Area
    * Ping (Latency)
    * XP per Hour (with % of level gained)
    * Estimated Time to Level Up
    * **Gold:** Current inventory and stored village gold.
    * **Gold per Hour (G/H):** Estimated gold earnings during your mapping session.

* **Detailed Mouseover Tooltip:** Hover over the info bar to see additional contextual information on a single line.
    *   **Last Area Summary:** After leaving a map, the tooltip will show the total Gold and XP you gained in that map.
